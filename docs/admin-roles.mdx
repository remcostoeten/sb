# Admin Roles

## Overview

The application implements a role-based access control system with two roles:
- `admin`: Users with elevated privileges
- `user`: Regular users with standard access

## Implementation

### Role Assignment

Roles are automatically assigned during signup based on the user's email address:

```ts
const role = getRoleForEmail(email, {
  adminEmail: process.env.VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL
});
```

### Usage

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/use-auth';

function MyComponent() {
  const { isAdmin } = useAuth();
  
  return isAdmin ? <AdminFeature /> : <UserFeature />;
}
```

## Configuration

Set the admin email in your `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
```
